    <h2>What is Git ? </h2>
    <p>By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).</p>

    <h2> 3 Version Control Systems of Git :</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Git Clone</li>
      <li>Git Commit</li>
      <li>Git Fork</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is Git Clone ?</h2>
    <p>In Git, cloning is the act of making a copy of any target repository. The target repository can be remote or local. You can clone your repository from the remote repository to create a local copy on your system. Also, you can sync between the two locations.</p>

    <h2>What is Git Commit ?</h2>
    <p>
        It is used to record the changes in the repository. It is the next command after the git add. Every commit contains the index data and the commit message. Every commit forms a parent-child relationship. When we add a file in Git, it will take place in the staging area. A commit command is used to fetch updates from the staging area to the repository.
        
        The staging and committing are co-related to each other. Staging allows us to continue in making changes to the repository, and when we want to share these changes to the version control system, committing allows us to record these changes.</p>

    <h2>What is Git Fork ?</h2>
    <p>A fork is a rough copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely test and debug with changes without affecting the original project. One of the excessive use of forking is to propose changes for bug fixing. To resolve an issue for a bug that you found, you can:

        <ul>
            <li>Fork the repository.</li>
            <li> Make the fix.</li>
            <li>Forward a pull request to the project owner.</li>
          </ul>
        
       
        </p>
